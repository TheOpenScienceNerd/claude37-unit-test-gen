# Generating Python Unit-Tests using Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

ðŸŽ“ This tutorial aims provides an example generic system prompt for Claude 3.7 to support unit-testing in python.  By following the tutorial you will:

* âœ… Gain an understanding of system prompting
* âœ… Understand different types of unit tests that can be generated
* âœ… Learn how to limit the number of tests generated to allow for human-in-the-loop checking

## Installation instructions

### Installing dependencies

All dependencies can be found in [`binder/environment.yml`]() and are pulled from conda-forge.  To run the code locally, we recommend installing [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge);

> miniforge is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) alternative to Anaconda and miniconda that uses conda-forge as the default channel for packages. It installs both conda and mamba (a drop in replacement for conda) package managers.  We recommend mamba for faster resolving of dependencies and installation of packages. 

navigating your terminal (or cmd prompt) to the directory containing the repo and issuing the following command:

```bash
mamba env create -f binder/environment.yml
```

Activate the mamba environment using the following command:

```bash
mamba activate unit_test
```
